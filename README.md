# 3D Printer Monitoring Dashboard

This dashboard simulates monitoring of a 3D printer in real-time, detecting failures like nozzle clogs, bed adhesion issues, and prolonged print times. Built with Streamlit and mock data, it's a prototype for a future hardware-integrated system.

## Features
- Nozzle and bed temp monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Basic failure detection
